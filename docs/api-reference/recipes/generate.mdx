description: "Generate 3 personalized, location-based meals with AI-generated images using advanced AI based on ingredients and user preferences"
---

## Overview

The recipe generation endpoint is the core of the Dysh API. It creates 3 unique, personalized meals **with AI-generated images** based on:

- **Ingredients**: 1-15 ingredients provided in the request
- **User Preferences**: Dietary restrictions, serving sizes from user profile
- **Location/Cuisine**: User's location or country override for cuisine style
- **AI Intelligence**: Advanced AI models that understand cooking techniques and flavor combinations
- **ðŸ†• AI Images**: Professional food photography-style images generated for each meal

<Note>
This endpoint requires authentication. Include a valid JWT access token in the Authorization header.
</Note>

## What's New: AI-Generated Meal Images ðŸŽ¨

Each recipe now includes a **professionally generated image** using Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview Image Generation:
- **High-quality food photography** style images
- **Restaurant-quality presentation** with beautiful plating
- **Professional lighting and composition**
- **Base64-encoded** for easy frontend integration
- **Automatic fallback** to placeholder if image generation fails

## Frontend Integration Best Practices

### Image Display
```jsx
// React component for displaying meal images
function MealImage({ meal }) {
  const [imageLoaded, setImageLoaded] = useState(false);
  const [imageError, setImageError] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div className="meal-image-container">
      {meal.image && !imageError ? (
        <img
          src={meal.image}
          alt={meal.name}
          onLoad={() => setImageLoaded(true)}
          onError={() => setImageError(true)}
          style={{
            display: imageLoaded ? 'block' : 'none',
            width: '100%',
            height: '300px',
            objectFit: 'cover',
            borderRadius: '8px'
          }}
        />
      ) : (
        <div className="image-placeholder">
          ðŸ“¸ Image not available
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Loading States
```jsx
// Enhanced loading state for recipe + image generation
function RecipeGenerationLoader() {
  return (
    <div className="loading-container">
      <div className="spinner" />
      <p>Generating personalized recipes...</p>
      <p className="sub-text">Creating AI images (12-15 seconds)</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
